# Electronic Voting Machine with Arduino UNO

ðŸš€ Welcome to my Electronic Voting Machine project repository! ðŸ¤–

## Project Overview
Electronic Voting Machine using Arduino UNO technology.

## Material Required
- Arduino UNO board and its CORD
- Breadboard
- 16x2 LCD
- Arduino UNO software - https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
- Connecting Pins and wires
- 9V Battery (for source, can also use power bank with cable)

## Working
- Each button is designated to each party
- the fifth button is for the RESULT
- The candidate with maximum vote is declared winner.
- The canditates with same vote, the result is a TIE.
- If no vote is done, the result shows no voting.

## Cheats ðŸ˜‰
- Connect the wires with breadboard, Arduino UNO board and LCD as shown in the Circuit Diagram Image.
- [*IMP*] Use a 16x2 LCD with soldered pins to easily attach it to breadboard
- use a PRESET instead of a potentiometer as it is efficient and saves space.

## Future Enhancements
As I conclude this phase, we're exploring possibilities for further enhancements and improvements. Your feedback and contributions are highly welcome!

## Connect with Us
I am eager to connect with the GitHub community and beyond. Feel free to reach out, open issues, or submit pull requests. Let's collaborate and advance this project together!

ðŸŒŸ Happy Coding! ðŸŒŸ
